# Races
Not all races should be playable in the game, but I think it would be fun to have a lot of the be available to have in the party, even as a "hired mercenary".

## Crystalith
A being made of stone and crystal. Does not need to sleep. Needs to rest to recharge. Large, loud and not at all subtle. Does not normally wear armour as it has natural armour that gets stronger the more it levels up. Has some slight psychic abilities to manipulate stone, metal and crystals.

## Dwarves
Stocky, sturdy, and hairy. Standard dwarves.

## Goblins
Obviously there will be goblins in the game. Goblins are generally fairly small and quick.

## Lizardkin
Humanoid lizards. Some have tails.

## Orc
Usually quite tall and has tusks jutting from its lower jaw.

## Ratkin
A rodent-like humanoid.

## Shifter
What does their natural form look like? Nobody really knows. Shifts and changes to a few forms at will. Each shifter can change into a few forms, not infinite.

## Troll
Tall creature that hates fire.
