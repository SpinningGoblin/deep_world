                        <h1 id="what-is-the-game"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-game">What is the Game?</a></h1>
<p>Deep World is a first person RPG where the player controls a group of adventurers as they jump from room to room, exploring the Deep World, levelling up and finding ingredients to help their local pub make better beer (maybe?).</p>
<h2 id="inspirations"><a class="header" href="#inspirations">Inspirations</a></h2>
<p>The game is inspired by old-school &quot;blobbers&quot;, tabletop role-playing games, and board games.</p>
<h2 id="objective"><a class="header" href="#objective">Objective</a></h2>
<p>Is there an endpoint? What is the goal?
There will be a progression to the ingredients and levels that the player can get to. The enemies will also get stronger, though there will be rooms that are
generated at lower difficulties, just for some variety. There will likely be a max level and a max quality to the ingredients that are retrieved during the trip through Deep World.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-world"><a class="header" href="#the-world">The World</a></h1>
<p>Deep World is deep underground. It is an endless underground space, which twists and morphs constantly. Permanent locations can be created and held consistent by magic, which is where the creatures (friendly and unfriendly) of this world gather.</p>
<p>These permanent locations can be expanded by bolstering the magic that sustains them. If that magic is ever destroyed or dispelled, the locations will slowly unravel and break apart, with them not able to be found again by other travelers.</p>
<h2 id="the-pub"><a class="header" href="#the-pub">The Pub</a></h2>
<p>The Pub is one such location that is being held together by a magic spell. As the world shifts around it, creatures can come across it as they travel. Creatures can stay at the pub (there's an inn as well), and goods can be traded while there.</p>
<p>The player is helping to run the Pub, and can provide ingredients, new recipes and other resources to help improve the Pub and its grounds.</p>
<h2 id="the-void"><a class="header" href="#the-void">The Void</a></h2>
<p>Connected to everything is the Void. It is all around the Deep World, and occasionally it finds its way in, especially when creatures die. When a member of the party dies, they can be revived, but pieces of them, shadows of their selves, will be taken by the Void and deposited in other worlds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="characters"><a class="header" href="#characters">Characters</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="./characters/races.html">Races</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="races"><a class="header" href="#races">Races</a></h1>
<p>Not all races should be playable in the game, but I think it would be fun to have a lot of the be available to have in the party, even as a &quot;hired mercenary&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="goblins"><a class="header" href="#goblins">Goblins</a></h2>
<p>Obviously there will be goblins in the game. Goblins are generally fairly small, quick, love tinkering with mechanisms like traps and are good with a few types of magic.</p>
<h2 id="dwarves"><a class="header" href="#dwarves">Dwarves</a></h2>
<p>Stocky, sturdy, and hairy. Standard dwarves. Love fighting in all its forms. Not great with magic, but there are some that get good at it.</p>
<h2 id="crystalith"><a class="header" href="#crystalith">Crystalith</a></h2>
<p>A being made of stone and crystal. Does not need to sleep. Needs to rest to recharge. Large, loud and not at all subtle. Does not normally wear armour as it has natural armour that gets stronger the more it levels up. Has some slight psychic abilities to manipulate stone, metal and crystals.</p>
<h2 id="ratkin"><a class="header" href="#ratkin">Ratkin</a></h2>
<p>A rodent-like humanoid.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h1>
<p>I think that having the characters have classes will give some structure to the characters leveling up.</p>
<h2 id="brewer"><a class="header" href="#brewer">Brewer</a></h2>
<p>Brews potions, explosives, poultices and similar things for use in combat. Can use some basic weapons without any other special training.</p>
<h2 id="barbarian"><a class="header" href="#barbarian">Barbarian</a></h2>
<p>Uses big weapons, does not wear a lot of armour.</p>
<h2 id="cleric"><a class="header" href="#cleric">Cleric</a></h2>
<p>Focuses on healing, hitting things and stopping the undead (the bad undead).</p>
<h2 id="fighter"><a class="header" href="#fighter">Fighter</a></h2>
<p>Likes to use most weapons. Combo attacks and working with others to take down foes.</p>
<h2 id="psychic"><a class="header" href="#psychic">Psychic</a></h2>
<p>Some creatures have some low-level psychic abilities that give them some abilities in combat.</p>
<h2 id="rogue"><a class="header" href="#rogue">Rogue</a></h2>
<p>Sneaks in shadow, which means they are good at going after enemies in shadow as well.</p>
<h2 id="speaker"><a class="header" href="#speaker">Speaker</a></h2>
<p>They speak to the Void, the walls of Deep World, or the powerful beings that reside there. Asks for favours from the ones they speak to against their enemies.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h1>
<h2 id="turn-based"><a class="header" href="#turn-based">Turn-Based</a></h2>
<p>To start I think I will try to go with turn-based combat. The player will decide
what actions each of the members of their party will do each turn.</p>
<h2 id="action-points"><a class="header" href="#action-points">Action Points?</a></h2>
<p>Each character will get a set number of action points they can spend each turn. Each character will have a base number of action points, and this will be augmented by their class and level. Each action/ability will use a number of
these action points.</p>
<p>The player might also have a fewer number of &quot;free actions&quot; they are able to do every turn, but these should likely be very limited.</p>
<h2 id="single-action"><a class="header" href="#single-action">Single Action?</a></h2>
<p>An alternative to having action points is to have every character get a single action (other than move) that they can do on their turn. One issue that I'd have to deal with is how to balance the fun of different more powerful attacks with the basic attacks that do less damage. Why do the lesser attacks if you've got more powerful attacks other than just having a set number of &quot;uses&quot; for the powerful attacks.</p>
<h2 id="enemies-in-shadow"><a class="header" href="#enemies-in-shadow">Enemies in Shadow</a></h2>
<p>One mechanism from a board/card game that I quite like is where some enemies in a room start off in shadow, so that the characters do not know what they are, and then only after being damaged once, or during their first attack are they revealed. Is there a way to incorporate that into this game?</p>
<p>Maybe the enemies that are still in shadow on their turn get <a href="combat.html#advantage">advantage</a> on some or all of their actions. Could also add an ability for one of the player characters to put themselves in shadow as well.</p>
<h2 id="exhausted-actions"><a class="header" href="#exhausted-actions">Exhausted Actions</a></h2>
<p>The same board game that has enemies in shadow also has a mechanism where an action is exhausted after it is used, and there are other actions that un-exhaust every other action, and that one cannot be exhausted.  I like the idea of this, and it could be fun to implement.</p>
<h2 id="small-grids"><a class="header" href="#small-grids">Small Grids</a></h2>
<p>The rooms will be divided into grids, on two sides. One side of the room for the party of adventurers and the other side of the room for the bad guys, though they may be slightly less grid-like. There will also be an upper grid and a lower grid. The upper grid will be for flying creatures and characters and then the lower grid is ground level.</p>
<p>Melee characters in the back of the grid cannot attack characters at the back of the other grid, they need to be in the front.</p>
<h2 id="advantage-and-disadvantage"><a class="header" href="#advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</a></h2>
<p>It would be nice to be able to have some characters get advantage or disadvantage when doing certain actions in combat. If I do attack rolls, it could be having advantage on the attack, or it could be advantage on the damage rolls.</p>
<h3 id="advantage"><a class="header" href="#advantage">Advantage</a></h3>
<p>The roll happens twice, and the best result is taken.</p>
<h3 id="disadvantage"><a class="header" href="#disadvantage">Disadvantage</a></h3>
<p>The roll happens twice, and the worse result is taken.</p>
<h2 id="flying-opponents"><a class="header" href="#flying-opponents">Flying Opponents</a></h2>
<p>Characters that are in the upper grid, either by flying or on a ledge/ladder have normal rolls against characters in the lower grid, unless they have a ranged or reach weapon, if they have one of those, they would have <a href="combat.html#advantage">advantage</a>. If a character is in the lower grid, they would have <a href="combat.html#disadvantage">disadvantage</a> attacking characters in the upper grid, unless they have a weapon with range or reach, in which case they will get a normal roll.</p>
<p>Maybe there will be certain weapons which would allow characters in the lower level to gain <a href="combat.html#advantage">advantage</a> over characters in the upper level, or allow them to ground them.</p>
<h2 id="initiative"><a class="header" href="#initiative">Initiative</a></h2>
<p>Initiative will be decided at the beginning of the fight. It will be a basic roll that is bolstered by their Agility, Dexterity, or similar attribute. There should also be ways of having characters change their placement in the initiative order, or possibly even completely resetting initiative order.</p>
<h2 id="attacking"><a class="header" href="#attacking">Attacking</a></h2>
<p>Do I want to have attack rolls or should attacks automatically hit and the rolls are only for the damage. Or should attacking/defending be more based on a card/board game where it is a bit more deterministic?</p>
<p>The player should be able to decide what enemy (or enemies) each member of the party targets and what type of attack they are going to do.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exploration"><a class="header" href="#exploration">Exploration</a></h1>
<p>The Deep World is made up of inter-connected rooms. The player can move its party from one room to another freely anytime they are not in combat. Some rooms might be locked/blocked by some of the creatures in the room.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-pub"><a class="header" href="#back-to-the-pub">Back to the Pub</a></h2>
<p>At any point in time when not in combat the player should be able to take their party back to the pub to drop off the ingredients they've collected, design new recipes and stock up for their next outing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rooms"><a class="header" href="#rooms">Rooms</a></h1>
<p>When exploring the Deep World, rooms will be what a party has encounters in. The party will travel from room to room, I am currently unsure if there will be anything happening in the connections between rooms.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./rooms/generation.html">Room Generation</a></li>
<li><a href="./rooms/room_types.html">Room Types</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="./rooms/room_types/combat_room.html">Combat Room</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="room-generation-basics"><a class="header" href="#room-generation-basics">Room Generation Basics</a></h1>
<p>Rooms will have an environment/theme to them, which will dictate what the floor and walls can look like. The section of the world that is being generated will also have its own biome which will then feed the theme choices for the room. This will dictate what the room looks like overall, and possibly also any fixtures (tables/chairs/weapon racks/etc) that are in the room. After this the type of room is picked, and then the generation for each takes over.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="room-types"><a class="header" href="#room-types">Room Types</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="rooms/./room_types/combat_room.html">Combat Room</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="combat-room"><a class="header" href="#combat-room">Combat Room</a></h1>
<p>The bulk of the rooms that will get generated are going to be combat rooms. There will be enemies that the party will have to fight to continue on to the next room(s).</p>
<h2 id="difficulty"><a class="header" href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a></h2>
<p>There will be 3 levels of difficulty for combat rooms. Easy, Medium and Hard.</p>
<h3 id="easy"><a class="header" href="#easy">Easy</a></h3>
<p>Easy rooms should be pretty basic. There would only be a limited number of enemies, or they'd be lower level if there's more of them. They would mostly be there for a slight change of pace, and maybe they'd be do some healing if they have abilities that let them heal during combat. Also might be a way to get easy ingredients or improvements for the pub.</p>
<h3 id="medium"><a class="header" href="#medium">Medium</a></h3>
<p>This will be the room that gets spawned the most often. It should offer a decent challenge but nothing that would wipe an entire party. If the party is at full health it should just do some ok damage to them, or maybe incapacitate a member if things go incredibly poorly.</p>
<h3 id="hard"><a class="header" href="#hard">Hard</a></h3>
<p>This should only be generated very rarely, and should have very good rewards for beating the monster in the room. Maybe something larger, or a larger party of bad guys. This is something that might incapacitate most of the party, or at least bring many of them down close to incapacitation.</p>
<h2 id="exits"><a class="header" href="#exits">Exits</a></h2>
<p>A room will always have an exit where the party came into the room through. Other than that exit, the room will have 0-3 other exits.</p>
<h3 id="locked-exits"><a class="header" href="#locked-exits">Locked Exits</a></h3>
<p>Some doors will be locked, possibly with locks that can be opened with keys that can be found (or lock picks), or by magic spells that would have to be dispelled if the party has the right way to accomplish that. I'd want to make sure that I don't force the party into a dead-end through no fault of themselves, e.g. a locked door with no keys available to them.</p>
