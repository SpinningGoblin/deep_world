# Combat Room
The bulk of the rooms that will get generated are going to be combat rooms. There will be enemies that the party will have to fight to continue on to the next room(s).

## Difficulty
There will be 3 levels of difficulty for combat rooms. Easy, Medium and Hard.

### Easy
Easy rooms should be pretty basic. There would only be a limited number of enemies, or they'd be lower level if there's more of them. They would mostly be there for a slight change of pace, and maybe they'd be do some healing if they have abilities that let them heal during combat. Also might be a way to get easy ingredients or improvements for the pub.

### Medium
This will be the room that gets spawned the most often. It should offer a decent challenge but nothing that would wipe an entire party. If the party is at full health it should just do some ok damage to them, or maybe incapacitate a member if things go incredibly poorly.

### Hard
This should only be generated very rarely, and should have very good rewards for beating the monster in the room. Maybe something larger, or a larger party of bad guys. This is something that might incapacitate most of the party, or at least bring many of them down close to incapacitation.

## Exits
A room will always have an exit where the party came into the room through. Other than that exit, the room will have 0-3 other exits.

### Locked Exits
Some doors will be locked, possibly with locks that can be opened with keys that can be found (or lock picks), or by magic spells that would have to be dispelled if the party has the right way to accomplish that. I'd want to make sure that I don't force the party into a dead-end through no fault of themselves, e.g. a locked door with no keys available to them.
