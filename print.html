                        <h1 id="what-is-the-game"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-game">What is the Game?</a></h1>
<p>Deep World is a first person RPG where the player controls a group of adventurers as they jump from room to room, exploring the Deep World, levelling up and finding ingredients to help their local pub make better beer (maybe?).</p>
<h2 id="inspirations"><a class="header" href="#inspirations">Inspirations</a></h2>
<p>The game is inspired by old-school "blobbers", tabletop role-playing games, and board games.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-the-game-feel-like"><a class="header" href="#what-should-the-game-feel-like">What should the game feel like?</a></h3>
<p>Main things I want the game to be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>tactics
<ul>
<li>combat should be interesting, and fun.</li>
<li>There should be a variable amount of challenge, determined by the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>exploration
<ul>
<li>The world should be interesting to explore, with lived in spaces</li>
<li>Even though the world is constantly changing, the rooms the player goes through still need to be interesting and possibly directly created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objective"><a class="header" href="#objective">Objective</a></h2>
<p>Is there an endpoint? What is the goal?
There will be a progression to the ingredients and levels that the player can get to. The enemies will also get stronger, though there will be rooms that are
generated at lower difficulties, just for some variety. There will likely be a max level and a max quality to the ingredients that are retrieved during the trip through Deep World.</p>
<h2 id="random-or-not-random"><a class="header" href="#random-or-not-random">Random or not random?</a></h2>
<p>The game might be semi-random. The rooms themselves, and the links between them will for the most part be created by hand, with maybe a bit of procedural generation to help out in some instances. I think it might be more interesting to attempt to put together a dungeon that is interesting to pass through.</p>
<p>The randomness might come in where the specific dungeon that the players will dive into will be decided randomly (ish, I wouldn't want the same one chosen all the time), so that there is some variety there.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-world"><a class="header" href="#the-world">The World</a></h1>
<p>Deep World is deep underground. It is an endless underground space, which twists and morphs constantly. Permanent locations can be created and held consistent by magic, which is where the creatures (friendly and unfriendly) of this world gather.</p>
<p>These permanent locations can be expanded by bolstering the magic that sustains them. If that magic is ever destroyed or dispelled, the locations will slowly unravel and break apart, with them not able to be found again by other travelers.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-deep-world"><a class="header" href="#exploring-the-deep-world">Exploring the Deep World</a></h2>
<p>People explore and move around the deep world by moving from room to room. The same rooms or areas will not stay connected once creatures leave without some magic there to hold them in place, otherwise something comes and moves them around, destroying the room and forming new ones somewhere else. Stay too long without something to keep the room intact and who knows what will happen.</p>
<p>Areas are connected by portals that change their form depending on the area. Sometimes a door, sometimes a window, sometimes just a hole in the floor. As you travel through the portals you'll appear in new rooms or ones held stable by magic.</p>
<h3 id="going-backwards"><a class="header" href="#going-backwards">Going backwards?</a></h3>
<p>Should people be able to go back to rooms they have already visited? Maybe there's a way for them to keep some of the rooms they've been to around and connected with a magic item.</p>
<h3 id="enemies-in-the-deep-world"><a class="header" href="#enemies-in-the-deep-world">Enemies in the Deep World</a></h3>
<p>There are lots of creatures in the Deep World, not all of them friendly. As the rooms shift and beings move through the portals they sometimes end up in the same room together.</p>
<h2 id="the-pub"><a class="header" href="#the-pub">The Pub</a></h2>
<p>The Pub is one such location that is being held together by a magic spell. As the world shifts around it, creatures can come across it as they travel. Creatures can stay at the pub (there's an inn as well), and goods can be traded while there.</p>
<p>The player is helping to run the Pub, and can provide ingredients, new recipes and other resources to help improve the Pub and its grounds.</p>
<h2 id="the-void"><a class="header" href="#the-void">The Void</a></h2>
<p>Connected to everything is the Void. It is all around the Deep World, and occasionally it finds its way in, especially when creatures die. When a member of the party dies, they can be revived, but pieces of them, shadows of their selves, will be taken by the Void and deposited in other worlds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="characters"><a class="header" href="#characters">Characters</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="./characters/ancestries.html">Ancestries</a></li>
<li><a href="./characters/classes.html">Classes</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ancestries"><a class="header" href="#ancestries">Ancestries</a></h1>
<p>Ancestries are your characters ancestral heritage.</p>
<p>Not all ancestries should be playable in the game, but I think it would be fun to have a lot of them be available to have in the party, even as a "hired mercenary".</p>
<h2 id="crystalith"><a class="header" href="#crystalith">Crystalith</a></h2>
<p>A being made of stone and crystal. Does not need to sleep. Needs to rest to recharge. Large, loud and not at all subtle. Does not normally wear armour as it has natural armour that gets stronger the more it levels up. Has some slight psychic abilities to manipulate stone, metal and crystals.</p>
<h2 id="dwarves"><a class="header" href="#dwarves">Dwarves</a></h2>
<p>Stocky, sturdy, and hairy. Standard dwarves.</p>
<h2 id="goblins"><a class="header" href="#goblins">Goblins</a></h2>
<p>Obviously there will be goblins in the game. Normally a bit shorter. They can see easily in the dark and their senses make them hard to surprise.</p>
<h2 id="lizardkin"><a class="header" href="#lizardkin">Lizardkin</a></h2>
<p>Humanoid lizards. Some have tails. Have a natural resistance to some elements or poisons.</p>
<h2 id="orc"><a class="header" href="#orc">Orc</a></h2>
<p>Usually quite tall and has tusks jutting from its lower jaw.</p>
<h2 id="ratkin"><a class="header" href="#ratkin">Ratkin</a></h2>
<p>A rodent-like humanoid.</p>
<h2 id="troll"><a class="header" href="#troll">Troll</a></h2>
<p>Tall creature that hates fire.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h1>
<p>I think that having the characters have classes will give some structure to the characters leveling up.</p>
<h2 id="animal-friend"><a class="header" href="#animal-friend">Animal Friend</a></h2>
<p>A friend to all types of creatures, can call upon them from other parts of the Deep World and they will come to their aid through special creature portals that they can create.</p>
<h2 id="crusher"><a class="header" href="#crusher">Crusher</a></h2>
<p>Uses big weapons or their hands, does not wear a lot of armour. Loves to grab their foes.</p>
<h2 id="light-tapper"><a class="header" href="#light-tapper">Light Tapper</a></h2>
<p>In the deep world light is magic and helps keep everything stable. Some can tap into the light directly to burn their foes and heal their companions.</p>
<h2 id="psychic"><a class="header" href="#psychic">Psychic</a></h2>
<p>Some creatures have some low-level psychic abilities that give them some abilities in combat.</p>
<h2 id="sneak"><a class="header" href="#sneak">Sneak</a></h2>
<p>Sneaks in shadow, which means they are good at going after enemies in shadow as well.</p>
<h2 id="void-speaker"><a class="header" href="#void-speaker">Void Speaker</a></h2>
<p>They speak to the Void, the walls of Deep World, or the powerful beings that reside in either. Asks for favours from the ones they speak to against their enemies or to aid their companions.</p>
<h2 id="tinkerer"><a class="header" href="#tinkerer">Tinkerer</a></h2>
<p>Loves brewing and working with machines. Brews potions, explosives, poultices and similar things for use in combat. Can use some basic weapons without any other special training. Builds automatons.</p>
<h2 id="warlock"><a class="header" href="#warlock">Warlock</a></h2>
<p>Casts spells. Learns new ones by absorbing magic items (scrolls, rings, etc) or levelling up.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-master"><a class="header" href="#weapon-master">Weapon Master</a></h2>
<p>Likes to use most weapons. Combo attacks and working with others to take down foes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-roll"><a class="header" href="#the-roll">The Roll</a></h1>
<p>The main roll in the game will be a 3d6 (at least for now) roll. The Roll will be used for any Test that needs to happen, like attacks or skills.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h1>
<h2 id="turn-based"><a class="header" href="#turn-based">Turn-Based</a></h2>
<p>The game will be a turn-based game when it comes to combat, or other "struggle" sections. In initiative order, the players will take their turn, and then the enemy will decide their action when its their turn. I will have to have some kind of manager to keep track of who's turn it is.</p>
<h2 id="actions"><a class="header" href="#actions">Actions</a></h2>
<p>Each character will be able to do 1 action, a move and maybe a few free/bonus actions.</p>
<p>Some characters, as they level up, might be able to do more actions, or they might be able to have more actions given to them by other characters.</p>
<h2 id="enemies-in-shadow"><a class="header" href="#enemies-in-shadow">Enemies in Shadow</a></h2>
<p>Some enemies will start <em>In Shadow</em> when the combat begins in a room. Enemies that are still in shadow by the time their turn comes will make their attacks with <a href="combat.html#advantage">advantage</a>. Certain creatures/ancestries/classes might be able to put themselves back into shadow.</p>
<p>Enemies will be considered to be in shadow or not in shadow for every member of the party, same for members of the party, where when one is in shadow, they'll be in shadow for all enemies.</p>
<p>There will also be skills for removing creatures from being in shadow, magical light spells, or if some characters can see in the dark, they can let the rest of the party know, maybe for a bonus action.</p>
<p>For reference, the start of this mechanic is based on a mechanic in</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181521/warhammer-quest-adventure-card-game">Warhammer Quest: Adventure Card Game</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exhausted-skills"><a class="header" href="#exhausted-skills">Exhausted Skills</a></h2>
<p>When players play the game, I want them to have reasons to use different skills, beyond just having some skills be more useful in certain contexts. I also don't necessarily want them to have to feel like they have to go rest to get their skills back all the time, where they only have the most options at the beginning right after a rest.</p>
<p>One way to accomplish this might be to have skills that only become available after a couple of encounters/victories, or after the character starts taking some damage or gets tired.</p>
<p>They also should have some skills/abilities that can be used at any time, as that way there is always something fun to do, even if it's isn't the most exciting ability.</p>
<h2 id="grid-based"><a class="header" href="#grid-based">Grid-based</a></h2>
<p>Most rooms will be divided into two grids. One grid will be for the "main" floor, and then another for an "upper". The upper grid would be for flying characters, or characters on upper parts of the floor. For the most part, the player characters will be on one side of the main grid and the enemies will be on the other.</p>
<p>Characters in the upper grid would be able to attack characters in the lower normally, unless they have specific weapons or skills, which might give them <a href="combat.html#advantage">advantage</a>. Characters in the lower grid would at best be able to attack normally with ranged weapons, <a href="combat.html#disadvantage">disadvantage</a> with normal weapons.</p>
<p>There should be ways for characters/creatures to drag others from the upper grid to the lower, using things like nets or similar.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong> - This might be hard to do in a first-person game.</p>
<h2 id="advantage-and-disadvantage"><a class="header" href="#advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</a></h2>
<p>It would be nice to be able to have some characters get advantage or disadvantage when doing certain actions in combat. If I do attack rolls, it could be having advantage on the attack, or it could be advantage on the damage rolls.</p>
<h3 id="advantage"><a class="header" href="#advantage">Advantage</a></h3>
<p>The roll happens twice, and the best result is taken. Or possibly you roll N + 1 dice, and keep the top N.</p>
<h3 id="disadvantage"><a class="header" href="#disadvantage">Disadvantage</a></h3>
<p>The roll happens twice, and the worse result is taken. Or possibly you roll N + 1 dice, and keep the bottom N.</p>
<h2 id="initiative"><a class="header" href="#initiative">Initiative</a></h2>
<p>Initiative will be decided at the beginning of the fight. It will be a basic roll that is bolstered by their Agility, Dexterity, or something similar. There should also be ways of having characters change their placement in the initiative order, or possibly even completely resetting initiative order.</p>
<h2 id="attacking"><a class="header" href="#attacking">Attacking</a></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some ideas taken from the MCDM RPG as well as others.</p>
<h3 id="attack-roll"><a class="header" href="#attack-roll">Attack Roll</a></h3>
<p>When attacking, <a href="./the_roll.html">The Roll</a> is used, and the result is compared against a small lookup table which gives the damage and other effects. I think this amount of randomness could be fun, with modifiers able to make higher damage more guaranteed if players have the resources.</p>
<h3 id="auto-hit"><a class="header" href="#auto-hit">Auto Hit</a></h3>
<p>There is no missing an attack, it will automatically hit, as will enemy attacks. To account for some of this, the HP will likely be upped for both players and monsters.</p>
<h3 id="targets-range-and-area-of-effect"><a class="header" href="#targets-range-and-area-of-effect">Targets, Range and Area of Effect</a></h3>
<p>All attack skills will have a Range and either a number of Targets, or an Area of Effect (AoE).</p>
<ul>
<li>Range - A value from 1 to N, where the value is the number of grid squares away the character must be.</li>
<li>Targets - The number of enemies the skill can hit at once. If the value is greater than 1, then the player will be able to click on each enemy to add to the selection.</li>
<li>Area of Effect - The shape of the attack as it overlays on the grid, could be a square of 4 cells, a line, or something else.
<ul>
<li>Will this work if I want to do first person?</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="room-to-room"><a class="header" href="#room-to-room">Room to Room</a></h1>
<p>The Deep World is made up of inter-connected rooms. The player can move its party from one room to another freely anytime they are not in combat.</p>
<h2 id="enemies"><a class="header" href="#enemies">Enemies</a></h2>
<p>If there are enemies present, leaving a room will require each character in the party to make an Agility check, modified by any passive abilities the character might have or else the enemy will get to do an attack on them.</p>
<h2 id="locked-doors"><a class="header" href="#locked-doors">Locked Doors</a></h2>
<p>Some doors and ways of leaving will be locked to the players until they either find a switch to open the door, pick the lock, or find the key that opens the door. I also might have spells available that can open locked doors, and the ability to dispel magic locks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-pub-1"><a class="header" href="#the-pub-1">The Pub</a></h1>
<p>The party has a magic pub that they travel with from which they can brew potions and beer. They can also choose to set the pub up for visitors, which would let them sell anything they'd like to passers by, getting them some gold, and maybe trading for items from other people.</p>
<p>At any time when enemies are not present, the characters can enter their pub to brew, tinker and prep for continuing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="towns"><a class="header" href="#towns">Towns</a></h1>
<p>There will occasionally be towns or other areas like fortresses which could be multiple rooms, sometimes most of the characters will be friendly or at least ambivalent to the characters.</p>
<p>These will be few and far between, because most of the game should be like a dungeon delve.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rooms"><a class="header" href="#rooms">Rooms</a></h1>
<p>When exploring the Deep World, rooms will be what a party has encounters in. The party will travel from room to room, I am currently unsure if there will be anything happening in the connections between rooms.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./rooms/generation.html">Room Generation</a></li>
<li><a href="./rooms/room_types.html">Room Types</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="./rooms/room_types/combat_room.html">Combat Room</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="room-generation-basics"><a class="header" href="#room-generation-basics">Room Generation Basics</a></h1>
<p>Rooms will have an environment/theme to them, which will dictate what the floor and walls can look like. The section of the world that is being generated will also have its own biome which will then feed the theme choices for the room. This will dictate what the room looks like overall, and possibly also any fixtures (tables/chairs/weapon racks/etc) that are in the room. After this the type of room is picked, and then the generation for each takes over.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="room-types"><a class="header" href="#room-types">Room Types</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="rooms/./room_types/combat_room.html">Combat Room</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="combat-room"><a class="header" href="#combat-room">Combat Room</a></h1>
<p>The bulk of the rooms that will get generated are going to be combat rooms. There will be enemies that the party will have to fight to continue on to the next room(s).</p>
<h2 id="difficulty"><a class="header" href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a></h2>
<p>There will be 3 levels of difficulty for combat rooms. Easy, Medium and Hard.</p>
<h3 id="easy"><a class="header" href="#easy">Easy</a></h3>
<p>Easy rooms should be pretty basic. There would only be a limited number of enemies, or they'd be lower level if there's more of them. They would mostly be there for a slight change of pace, and maybe they'd be do some healing if they have abilities that let them heal during combat. Also might be a way to get easy ingredients or improvements for the pub.</p>
<h3 id="medium"><a class="header" href="#medium">Medium</a></h3>
<p>This will be the room that gets spawned the most often. It should offer a decent challenge but nothing that would wipe an entire party. If the party is at full health it should just do some ok damage to them, or maybe incapacitate a member if things go incredibly poorly.</p>
<h3 id="hard"><a class="header" href="#hard">Hard</a></h3>
<p>This should only be generated very rarely, and should have very good rewards for beating the monster in the room. Maybe something larger, or a larger party of bad guys. This is something that might incapacitate most of the party, or at least bring many of them down close to incapacitation.</p>
<h2 id="exits"><a class="header" href="#exits">Exits</a></h2>
<p>A room will always have an exit where the party came into the room through. Other than that exit, the room will have 0-3 other exits.</p>
<h3 id="locked-exits"><a class="header" href="#locked-exits">Locked Exits</a></h3>
<p>Some doors will be locked, possibly with locks that can be opened with keys that can be found (or lock picks), or by magic spells that would have to be dispelled if the party has the right way to accomplish that. I'd want to make sure that I don't force the party into a dead-end through no fault of themselves, e.g. a locked door with no keys available to them.</p>
