# What is the Game?

Deep World is a first person RPG where the player controls a group of adventurers as they jump from room to room, exploring the Deep World, levelling up and finding ingredients to help their local pub make better beer (maybe?).

## Inspirations

The game is inspired by old-school "blobbers", tabletop role-playing games, and board games.

### What should the game feel like?

Main things I want the game to be about:

-   tactics
    -   Challenge should be determined by the player.
-   exploration
    -   The world should be interesting to explore, with lived in spaces
    -   Even though the world is constantly changing, the rooms the player goes through still need to be interesting and possibly directly created.

## Objective

Is there an endpoint? What is the goal?
There will be a progression to the ingredients and levels that the player can get to. The enemies will also get stronger, though there will be rooms that are
generated at lower difficulties, just for some variety. There will likely be a max level and a max quality to the ingredients that are retrieved during the trip through Deep World.

## Random or not random?

The game might be semi-random. The rooms themselves, and the links between them will for the most part be created by hand, with maybe a bit of procedural generation to help out in some instances. I think it might be more interesting to attempt to put together a dungeon that is interesting to pass through.

The randomness might come in where the specific dungeon that the players will dive into will be decided randomly (ish, I wouldn't want the same one chosen all the time), so that there is some variety there.
