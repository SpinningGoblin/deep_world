# What is the Game?
Deep World is a first person RPG where the player controls a group of adventurers as they jump from room to room, exploring the Deep World, levelling up and finding ingredients to help their local pub make better beer (maybe?).

## Inspirations
The game is inspired by old-school "blobbers", tabletop role-playing games, and board games.
