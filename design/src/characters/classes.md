# Classes
I think that having the characters have classes will give some structure to the characters leveling up.

## Animal Friend
A friend to all types of creatures, can call upon them from other parts of the Deep World and they will come to their aid through special creature portals that they can create.

## Brewer
Brews potions, explosives, poultices and similar things for use in combat. Can use some basic weapons without any other special training.

## Barbarian
Uses big weapons or their hands, does not wear a lot of armour.

## Cleric
Focuses on healing, hitting things and stopping the undead (the bad undead).

## Fighter
Likes to use most weapons. Combo attacks and working with others to take down foes.

## Psychic
Some creatures have some low-level psychic abilities that give them some abilities in combat.

## Sneak
Sneaks in shadow, which means they are good at going after enemies in shadow as well.

## Speaker
They speak to the Void, the walls of Deep World, or the powerful beings that reside in either. Asks for favours from the ones they speak to against their enemies.

## Tinkerer
Loves to work with magical machines. Also builds automatons, some of which can even fly.

## Warlock
Casts spells. Learns new ones by absorbing magic items (scrolls, rings, etc) or levelling up.
