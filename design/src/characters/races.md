# Races
Not all races should be playable in the game, but I think it would be fun to have a lot of the be available to have in the party, even as a "hired mercenary".

## Goblins
Obviously there will be goblins in the game. Goblins are generally fairly small, quick, love tinkering with mechanisms like traps and are good with a few types of magic.

## Dwarves
Stocky, sturdy, and hairy. Standard dwarves. Love fighting in all its forms. Not great with magic, but there are some that get good at it.

## Crystalith
A being made of stone and crystal. Does not need to sleep. Needs to rest to recharge. Large, loud and not at all subtle. Does not normally wear armour as it has natural armour that gets stronger the more it levels up. Has some slight psychic abilities to manipulate stone, metal and crystals.

## Ratkin
A rodent-like humanoid.
