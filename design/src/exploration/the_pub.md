# The Pub

The party has a magic pub that they travel with from which they can brew potions and beer. They can also choose to set the pub up for visitors, which would let them sell anything they'd like to passers by, getting them some gold, and maybe trading for items from other people.

At any time when enemies are not present, the characters can enter their pub to brew, tinker and prep for continuing.
