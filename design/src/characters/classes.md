# Classes
I think that having the characters have classes will give some structure to the characters leveling up.

## Brewer
Brews potions, explosives, poultices and similar things for use in combat. Can use some basic weapons without any other special training.

## Barbarian
Uses big weapons, does not wear a lot of armour.

## Cleric
Focuses on healing, hitting things and stopping the undead (the bad undead).

## Fighter
Likes to use most weapons. Combo attacks and working with others to take down foes.

## Psychic
Some creatures have some low-level psychic abilities that give them some abilities in combat.

## Rogue
Sneaks in shadow, which means they are good at going after enemies in shadow as well.

## Speaker
They speak to the Void, the walls of Deep World, or the powerful beings that reside there. Asks for favours from the ones they speak to against their enemies.
