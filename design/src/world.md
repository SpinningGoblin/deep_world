# The World
Deep World is deep underground. It is an endless underground space, which twists and morphs constantly. Permanent locations can be created and held consistent by magic, which is where the creatures (friendly and unfriendly) of this world gather.

These permanent locations can be expanded by bolstering the magic that sustains them. If that magic is ever destroyed or dispelled, the locations will slowly unravel and break apart, with them not able to be found again by other travellers.

## The Pub
The pub is one such location that is being held together by a magic spell. As the world shifts around it, creatures can come across it as they travel. Creatures can stay at the pub (there's an inn as well), and goods can be traded while there.

The player is helping to run the Pub, and can provide ingredients, new recipes and other resources to help improve the Pub and its grounds.

## The Void
Connected to everything is the Void. It is all around the Deep World, and occasionally it finds its way in, especially when creatures die. When a member of the party dies, they can be revived, but pieces of them, shadows of their selves, will be taken by the Void and deposited in other worlds.
