# Ancestries

Ancestries are your characters ancestral heritage.

Not all ancestries should be playable in the game, but I think it would be fun to have a lot of them be available to have in the party, even as a "hired mercenary".

## Crystalith

A being made of stone and crystal. Does not need to sleep. Needs to rest to recharge. Large, loud and not at all subtle. Does not normally wear armour as it has natural armour that gets stronger the more it levels up. Has some slight psychic abilities to manipulate stone, metal and crystals.

## Dwarves

Stocky, sturdy, and hairy. Standard dwarves.

## Goblins

Obviously there will be goblins in the game. Normally a bit shorter. They can see easily in the dark and their senses make them hard to surprise.

## Lizardkin

Humanoid lizards. Some have tails. Have a natural resistance to some elements or poisons.

## Orc

Usually quite tall and has tusks jutting from its lower jaw.

## Ratkin

A rodent-like humanoid.

## Troll

Tall creature that hates fire.
