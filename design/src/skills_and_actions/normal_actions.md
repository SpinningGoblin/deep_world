# Normal Actions

## Attack

Attack an enemy or almost anything interactive in the room. Will use whatever weapon (if any) is equipped.

## Hide

Any character can attempt to hide from the enemies when they are in the same room, whether or not it succeeds is another matter. This will put them into "shadow".

## Throw

You can throw items you're carrying, items or fixtures in the room, or if you are able to grab an enemy, you could throw them too.
