# Classes

I think that having the characters have classes will give some structure to the characters leveling up.

## Animal Friend

A friend to all types of creatures, can call upon them from other parts of the Deep World and they will come to their aid through special creature portals that they can create.

## Crusher

Uses big weapons or their hands, does not wear a lot of armour. Loves to grab their foes.

## Light Tapper

In the deep world light is magic and helps keep everything stable. Some can tap into the light directly to burn their foes and heal their companions.

## Psychic

Some creatures have some low-level psychic abilities that give them some abilities in combat.

## Sneak

Sneaks in shadow, which means they are good at going after enemies in shadow as well.

## Void Speaker

They speak to the Void, the walls of Deep World, or the powerful beings that reside in either. Asks for favours from the ones they speak to against their enemies or to aid their companions.

## Tinkerer

Loves brewing and working with machines. Brews potions, explosives, poultices and similar things for use in combat. Can use some basic weapons without any other special training. Builds automatons.

## Warlock

Casts spells. Learns new ones by absorbing magic items (scrolls, rings, etc) or levelling up.

## Weapon Master

Likes to use most weapons. Combo attacks and working with others to take down foes.
