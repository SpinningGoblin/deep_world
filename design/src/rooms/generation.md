# Room Generation Basics
Rooms will have an environment/theme to them, which will dictate what the floor and walls can look like. The section of the world that is being generated will also have its own biome which will then feed the theme choices for the room. This will dictate what the room looks like overall, and possibly also any fixtures (tables/chairs/weapon racks/etc) that are in the room. After this the type of room is picked, and then the generation for each takes over.
