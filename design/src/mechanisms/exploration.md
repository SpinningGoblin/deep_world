# Exploration
The Deep World is made up of inter-connected rooms. The player can move its party from one room to another freely anytime they are not in combat. Some rooms might be locked/blocked by some of the creatures in the room.

## Back to the Pub
At any point in time when not in combat the player should be able to take their party back to the pub to drop off the ingredients they've collected, design new recipes and stock up for their next outing.
