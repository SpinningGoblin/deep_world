# Combat

## Turn-Based
To start I think I will try to go with turn-based combat. The player will decide
what actions each of the members of their party will do each turn.

## Action Points?
Each character will get a set number of action points they can spend each turn. Each character will have a base number of action points, and this will be augmented by their class and level. Each action/ability will use a number of
these action points.

The player might also have a fewer number of "free actions" they are able to do every turn, but these should likely be very limited.

## Single Action?
An alternative to having action points is to have every character get a single action (other than move) that they can do on their turn. One issue that I'd have to deal with is how to balance the fun of different more powerful attacks with the basic attacks that do less damage. Why do the lesser attacks if you've got more powerful attacks other than just having a set number of "uses" for the powerful attacks.

## Enemies in Shadow
One mechanism from a board/card game that I quite like is where some enemies in a room start off in shadow, so that the characters do not know what they are, and then only after being damaged once, or during their first attack are they revealed. Is there a way to incorporate that into this game?

Maybe the enemies that are still in shadow on their turn get [advantage](#advantage) on some or all of their acrions. Could also add an ability for one of the player characters to put themselves in shadow as well.

## Exhausted Actions
The same board game that has enemies in shadow also has a mechanism where an action is exhausted after it is used, and there are other actions that unexhaust every other action, and that one cannot be exhausted.  I like the idea of this, and it could be fun to implement.

## Small Grids
The rooms will be divided into grids, on two sides. One side of the room for the party of adventurers and the other side of the room for the bad guys, though they may be slightly less grid-like. There will also be an upper grid and a lower grid. The upper grid will be for flying creatures and characters and then the lower grid is ground level.

Melee characters in the back of the grid cannot attack characters at the back of the other grid, they need to be in the front.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
It would be nice to be able to have some characters get advantage or disadvantage when doing certain actions in combat. If I do attack rolls, it could be having advantage on the attack, or it could be advantage on the damage rolls.

### Advantage
The roll happens twice, and the best result is taken.

### Disadvantage
The roll happens twice, and the worse result is taken.

## Flying Opponents
Characters that are in the upper grid, either by flying or on a ledge/ladder have normal rolls against characters in the lower grid, unless they have a ranged or reach weapon, if they have one of those, they would have [advantage](#advantage). If a character is in the lower grid, they would have [disadvantage](#disadvantage) attacking characters in the upper grid, unless they have a weapon with range or reach, in which case they will get a normal roll.

Maybe there will be certain weapons which would allow characters in the lower level to gain [advantage](#advantage) over characters in the upper level, or allow them to ground them.

## Initiative
Initiative will be decided at the beginning of the fight. It will be a basic roll that is bolstered by their Agility, Dexterity, or similar attribute. There should also be ways of having characters change their placement in the initiative order, or possibly even completely resetting initiative order.

## Attacking
Do I want to have attack rolls or should attacks automatically hit and the rolls are only for the damage. Or should attacking/defending be more based on a card/board game where it is a bit more deterministic?

The player should be able to decide what enemy (or enemies) each member of the party targets and what type of attack they are going to do.
