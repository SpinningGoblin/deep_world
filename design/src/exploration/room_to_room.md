# Room to Room

The Deep World is made up of inter-connected rooms. The player can move its party from one room to another freely anytime they are not in combat.

## Enemies

If there are enemies present, leaving a room will require each character in the party to make an Agility check, modified by any passive abilities the character might have or else the enemy will get to do an attack on them.

## Locked Doors

Some doors and ways of leaving will be locked to the players until they either find a switch to open the door, pick the lock, or find the key that opens the door. I also might have spells available that can open locked doors, and the ability to dispel magic locks.
