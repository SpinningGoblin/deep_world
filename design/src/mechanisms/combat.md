# Combat

## Turn-Based
To start I think I will try to go with turn-based combat. The player will decide
what actions each of the members of their party will do each turn.

## Action Points
Each character will get a set number of action points they can spend each turn. Each character will have a base number of action points, and this will be augmented by their class and level. Each action/ability will use a number of
these action points.

The player might also have a fewer number of "free actions" they are able to do every turn, but these should likely be very limited.

## Enemies in Shadow
One mechanism from a board/card game that I quite like is where some enemies in a room start off in shadow, so that the characters do not know what they are, and then only after being damaged once, or during their first attack are they revealed. Is there a way to incorporate that into this game?
