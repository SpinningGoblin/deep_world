# The World

Deep World is deep underground. It is an endless underground space, which twists and morphs constantly. Permanent locations can be created and held consistent by magic, which is where the creatures (friendly and unfriendly) of this world gather.

These permanent locations can be expanded by bolstering the magic that sustains them. If that magic is ever destroyed or dispelled, the locations will slowly unravel and break apart, with them not able to be found again by other travelers.

## Exploring the Deep World

People explore and move around the deep world by moving from room to room. The same rooms or areas will not stay connected once creatures leave without some magic there to hold them in place, otherwise something comes and moves them around, destroying the room and forming new ones somewhere else. Stay too long without something to keep the room intact and who knows what will happen.

Areas are connected by portals that change their form depending on the area. Sometimes a door, sometimes a window, sometimes just a hole in the floor. As you travel through the portals you'll appear in new rooms or ones held stable by magic.

### Going backwards?

Should people be able to go back to rooms they have already visited? Maybe there's a way for them to keep some of the rooms they've been to around and connected with a magic item.

### Enemies in the Deep World

There are lots of creatures in the Deep World, not all of them friendly. As the rooms shift and beings move through the portals they sometimes end up in the same room together.

## The Pub

The Pub is one such location that is being held together by a magic spell. As the world shifts around it, creatures can come across it as they travel. Creatures can stay at the pub (there's an inn as well), and goods can be traded while there.

The player is helping to run the Pub, and can provide ingredients, new recipes and other resources to help improve the Pub and its grounds.

## The Void

Connected to everything is the Void. It is all around the Deep World, and occasionally it finds its way in, especially when creatures die. When a member of the party dies, they can be revived, but pieces of them, shadows of their selves, will be taken by the Void and deposited in other worlds.
