# What is the Game?

Deep World is a first person RPG where the player controls a group of adventurers as they jump from room to room, exploring the Deep World, levelling up and finding ingredients to help their local pub make better beer (maybe?).

## Inspirations

The game is inspired by old-school "blobbers", tabletop role-playing games, and board games.

## Objective

Is there an endpoint? What is the goal?
There will be a progression to the ingredients and levels that the player can get to. The enemies will also get stronger, though there will be rooms that are
generated at lower difficulties, just for some variety. There will likely be a max level and a max quality to the ingredients that are retrieved during the trip through Deep World.

## Random or not random?

Part of me wants this game to be randomized, where rooms are random, based on biomes or other things, and the world shifts and changes as you explore and go to and from the Pub. But another part of me wants to design the world and dungeons because it might be simpler? Is there a way to do both?
